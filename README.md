# Book Recommendation System

This project implements a personalized book recommendation engine using machine learning. Users interact with an easy-to-use web interface to get book suggestions based on their selected titles. 
The project flows from exploratory data analysis in Jupyter notebooks to production-ready Python code using Streamlit (or Flask).

## Features
- Provides personalized book recommendations based on user input
- Interactive web interface for selecting books and viewing recommendations
- Clean, modular Python codebase for scalability and maintenance
- Jupyter notebook included for data exploration and model prototyping
- Version controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+
- Streamlit (or Flask) for web app interface
- pandas, scikit-learn, pickle for data handling and ML
- Git for version control

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
git clone https://github.com/Eku12345/Book_recommendation_system.git
cd Book_recommendation_system 
python3 -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate 
# Use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows pip install -r requirements.txt streamlit run app.py 
# Or python app.py if using Flask

## Usage
- Select a book title from the dropdown menu.
